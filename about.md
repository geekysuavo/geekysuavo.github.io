# Hi!

<img src="{{ site.db }}/res/images/me.png" class="mythumb" />
I'm Brad. I put together this website to document a few of the projects
I consider to be (at least partially) successful or interesting. Some
are very old, while others are new and even unfinished. But hopefully
all are interesting to you!

My interests span almost everything, from both playing and enjoying music,
to swimming and cycling, to chemistry, electronics and software design.
I'm not comfortable posting my singing voice to the internet, so this
website focuses on the last three mentioned interests! **:P**

# What I do

I'm currently a Ph.D postdoctoral research fellow at the Pasteur Institute.
Because of my long-standing interest in computer software and hardware, I
have become both a researcher and a system administrator.
[My research](sci.html) focuses on applied mathematics and computer science,
specifically in modeling complex data of chemical mixtures, protein structure
and dynamics, and multivariate statistical analysis. My sysadmin and
programming work usually focuses around maintaining file, web and software
servers for one or more research groups, _e.g._,
[the Power's group website](http://bionmr.unl.edu). In the few free moments
I get these days, I like to tinker with [electronics](hw.html), and when
I just have to procrastinate at work, I write small pieces of
[software](sw.html).

Really, the relevant question is: what don't I do? **:)** If it's going to
be a challenge, odds are that I'm game.

# Anyways, welcome!

In a nutshell, welcome to my personal website. **:D**
