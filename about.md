# Hi!

<img src="{{ site.db }}/res/images/me.png" class="mythumb" />
I'm Brad. I put together this website to document a few of the projects
I consider to be (at least partially) successful or interesting. Some
are very old, while others are new and even unfinished. But hopefully
all are interesting to you!

My interests span almost everything, from both playing and enjoying music,
to swimming and cycling, to chemistry, electronics and software design.
I'm not comfortable posting my singing voice to the internet, so this
website focuses on the last three mentioned interests! **:P**

# What I do

I'm currently a senior scientist at [Atomwise](www.atomwise.com) in the
**ml.research** group, spending 100% of my time on software engineering
of our machine learning frameworks and the other 100% on research into
new algorithms and architectures.

Because of my long-standing interest in computer software and hardware, I
am both a scientist and an engineer. My [research](sci.html) focuses on
applied mathematics and computer science, specifically in modeling complex
data of chemical mixtures, protein structure and dynamics, and multivariate
directional statisticx. My engineering work has spanned system
administration for [the Powers group](http://bionmr.unl.edu),
project management of complex deep learning software suites,
and execution of research project ideas. In the few free moments
I get these days, I like to tinker with [electronics](hw.html),
and when I just have to procrastinate on useful work,
I write small pieces of [software](sw.html).

Really, the relevant question is: what don't I do? **:)** If it's going to
be a challenge, odds are that I'm game.

# Anyways, welcome!

In a nutshell, welcome to my personal website. **:D**
