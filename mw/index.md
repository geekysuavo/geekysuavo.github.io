# Introduction

The Matrix Weapons mutator for Unreal Tournament Game of The Year Edition
was effectively a set of Counterstrike weapons converted for use in UT GOTY,
with an added feature of slow-motion, like in The Matrix. Turning on bullet
time would slow everything down, giving the player superhuman speed and
reflexes, with super-cool weapons.

It was a fun mod to play with.

# The files

Unzip both files from the zip file and copy them into your Unreal system
directory. (_i.e._ **C:\UnrealTournament\System**) then fire up a text editor
and open up your **UnrealTournament.ini** file, which is in the same directory.
Find the _[Engine.GameEngine]_ section and scroll down to the end of the
ServerPackages entries. Add an entry like so:

```
 ServerPackages=MatrixWeapons
```

Save and close the file. After that, you should be good to start UT and add
the _Smack's Ultimate Gun Pack_ mutator to any match you like. Remember
to bind a key for the slomo toggle!
