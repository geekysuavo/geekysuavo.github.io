# geekysuavo.github.io

This is the repostory for my website, hosted by GitHub at
[geekysuavo.github.io](http://geekysuavo.github.io).

My original site was written for PHP hosting, so I had to adapt the server
side code to straight client side Javascript. All in all, I'm very happy
with how simple it is to create content in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
once the boilerplate is done, that is. **:)**
