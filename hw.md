    caption: Earth's field NMR experiments
    content: >
      I work with NMR spectrometers on a daily basis, and while it would
      be nice to engineer a complete spectrometer, I really don't have the
      time or the money to gain enough experience... yet. This is an NMR
      project I knew I could chew in around a year: a proton precession
      magnetometer.

      Let's just get it out there: programmers are a bit lazy. Our laziness
      is special, because it motivates us to work really hard up front in
      order to sit back and drink margaritas later (and longer) while our
      newly written scripts do the real work. This is that spirit applied
      to collecting data for transfer function plotting on a digital scope.

    caption: A scrap-built guitar tube amplifier
    content: >
      This project started when I found an old Eico 460 tube oscilloscope
      in my Grandpa's old shed. The collection of tubes, passives and
      magnetics inside turned out to be perfect for building a fairly
      clean-sounding tube guitar amplifier.

    caption: My take on the Szekeres headphone amp
    content: >
      This project was my first foray into proper linear analog electronics.
      After a few microcontroller projects, I figured I'd try to build my own
      rendition of the Szekeres. I'm more proud of the machining work in this
      project, honestly.

    caption: My first hack at a Nixie tube clock
    content: >
      Nixie tube clocks were all the rage when I jumped in on this bandwagon.
      I still love the warmth of these classic indicator tubes; there's
      nothing quite like them.

    caption: A simple LED-based digital clock
    content: >
      As LED clocks go, this is pretty basic. Clocks are simple enough
      to invite the beginning microcontroller hardware designer for
      a try, but complex enough to be at least somewhat fun. Here's
      what I made.

    caption: My first MCU project, a digital thermometer
    content: >
      I wanted to get started with AVR microcontrollers, and since
      Arduino wasn't a thing back then, I rolled my own board for a
      self-contained digital thermometer using the ever-popular DS18B20.
