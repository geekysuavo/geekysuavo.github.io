  - link: gpufield
    caption: The GPUfield Biot-Savart solver
    content: >
      This software uses the Biot-Savart equation (under a piecewise linear
      approximation) to compute the magnetic field around wire electromagnets
      of arbitrary three-dimensional geometry. It's also
      CUDA-accelerated. <b>:)</b>
  - link: orbitals
    caption: Hydrogen wavefunction OSX screensaver
    content: >
      An extremely simple look into the position wavefunction of the lone
      electron of a hydrogen atom, in screensaver form. I needed to
      procrastinate during the time leading up to my graduate student
      original oral proposal, so I wrote this.
  - link: notifier
    caption: A GMail Notifier for the GNOME desktop
    content: >
      Now-orphaned software that tracks however many gmail inboxes you have
      and lets you know when new mail arrives. When I originally wrote the
      software, no other notifier existed for the Gnome desktop that was up
      to par. Now my package has slipped far under par too!
  - link: bezier
    caption: A quick play with drawing Bezier curves
    content: >
      A long time ago - was it high school? - I wrote a small C program
      to render Bezier curves based on their control points to PostScript
      files. It was my first play with linked lists, too. Yep, an oldie.
  - link: pkg
    caption: A twist on the Slackware package management scripts
    content: >
      When I moved from Slackware to Linux From Scratch (a long, long
      time ago) I decided to re-envision the slackpkg tools for my purposes.
      The <b>pkg</b> scripts were the 'fruits' of my labor.
  - link: phpkg
    caption: A PHP interface for the Pkg scripts
    content: >
      Of course my package management scripts needed a repo. Think big
      or go home right? Ahh... youth.
  - link: mw
    caption: Another CS/BulletTime mod for UT GOTY
    content: >
      My first and only successful mod for Unreal Tournament. It's really
      just a bunch of Counterstrike weapons converted to work in UT GOTY,
      with the added ability to enter 'bullet time' and become superhuman!
